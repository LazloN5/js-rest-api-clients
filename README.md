# DatoCMS JS REST API Clients

This monorepo contains API clients to interact with DatoCMS:

- `@datocms/cma-client-browser`: Client for the [Content Management API](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api) (to be used in browser environments).
- `@datocms/cma-client-node`: Client for the [Content Management API](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api) (to be used in NodeJS environments).
- `@datocms/dashboard-client`: Client for the Dashboard Management API (can be used in any JS environment).
- `@datocms/rest-api-events`: Can be used with any of the above clients to use real-time updates instead of polling to retrieve the result of asyncronous jobs.
